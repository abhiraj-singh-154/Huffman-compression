# Huffman Compression (C++)
## Project Overview
Huffman Compression is a C++ implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm — a classic lossless data compression technique. The program reads a file, builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies, compresses the file into a binary format, and can also decompress it back to the original file.
