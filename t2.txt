Axion Prime Urban Redevelopment Log
=================================

Year 2147. Sector A-19.  
The city of Axion Prime stretches endlessly in a perfect grid, yet chaos hides beneath its symmetry.
Each building stands as a data point — coordinates etched in steel, costs buried in contracts.

This document is a synthetic large text file intended for testing repositories, file handling,
and version control systems.
